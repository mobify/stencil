# Visiblity Utilities

Visibility utilities allow you to control the visibility of elements. This can either be hiding an element completely, or only visually (allowing screen readers to still access the hidden element).


## Installation

Refer to the main [installation instructions for Stencil](https://github.com/mobify/stencil#installation).

Use the following to import the utility into your project with Sass:

```
@import '../bower_components/mobify-stencil/dist/utils/visibility/visibility';
```


## Using the Visibility Utility


### Example Markup

```html
<i class="c-icon" data-icon-name="twitter"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Twitter</span></i>
```
