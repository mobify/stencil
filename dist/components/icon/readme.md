# Icon Component Template

An element is made into an icon by adding either the `c-icon` class, and/or
adding the `data-icon-name` attribute with an existing value from the
`$icon-list` map.

Optionally, you can set any icon to replace any text by adding the `c-icon--replace`
class, or by setting the attribute `data-icon-replace` to true
