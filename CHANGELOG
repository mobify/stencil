0.1.0
    - We should start managing versions for Stencil. This is a start.
    - Added Alert component

0.2.0
    - An initial "template" that new stencil components can start off with
    - Tests for all existing components
    - The following components:
        * Breadcrumb
        * Icon
        * Select
        * Test (technically not a stencil, it's for scaffolding)
    - Added Readme files for all stencils, utilities and to the project root
    - Cleaned up most (although not all) SCSS style inconsistencies
